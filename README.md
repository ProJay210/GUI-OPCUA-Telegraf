# GUI-OPCUA-Telegraf
GO Language implementation of GUI tool for configuring telegraf config.

Although I am not a full fledged GO Language programmer or programmer in general. I have used my basic understanding skill and with the help of GO OPC UA project and help of AI models, i have created this project.

This is not to be used in any type of production environment nor it is aimed to.

Also, the project itself is very clunky and not ideal for a fledged application for this use case.

1. It only supports SecurityMode: None and when the node ids in a Server are large, it struggles to fetch all Nodes and rendering related the GUI.

Feel free to fork and create a better version of itself.
